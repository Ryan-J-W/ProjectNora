Project Nora; my own open source virtual assistant

Project Nora, Nora standing for "No obvious relating acronym" will be written mostly in python, as well as c++ and R occasionally.  The goal is to create my own virtual assistant from scratch, and creating all of the models used myself.  I will be using as few prebuilt libraries as possible.

One of the subgoals of Project Nora is to familiarize myself with natural language processing, RNN's and not relying on prebuilt libraries to create projects.  
Another aspect of the project would be to eventually implement NORA into the an Ubuntu or other linux OS such that it could act on Ubuntu like Siri acts on IOS
or Cortana of Microsoft.
